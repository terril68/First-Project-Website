                <p>A story by Teresa Liu</p>
                <p>
                    The COVID-19 pandemic forced Americans to stay home, so many have turned to a furry friend as a way to cope with stress and loneliness. This resulted in a nationwide surge of pet adoptions. However, as data from Shelter Animals Count suggests, the annual number of animals entering shelters has been steadily declining since the start of the pandemic, resulting in fewer adoptions.

                <iframe title="As shelter  intakes decrease, so do adoptions" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-q0Ih2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/q0Ih2/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="324"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

                    As Chart 1 demonstrates, demand for adoptions peaked in 2020, when the COVID-19 first reached the US. The number of adoptions actually fell in 2020 and 2021, compared with the previous years. This was due to a decrease in the total number of animals entering shelters and rescue groups. In other words, the number of people willing to adopt outpaced the number of animals available for adoption.

                    Chart 2 shows the quantitative difference between animal intakes and adoptions each year more clearly. The smallest differences were found in 2020 and 2021, when there were only 1.3 million and 1.1 million in differences between total animal intakes and adoptions, respectively. During this time, animal shelters across the nation saw sudden swarms of new applications for dogs and cats, many news outlets reported.

                    “It’s been phenomenal. I’ve never seen this industry like it’s been this year,” Melissa McCalister, co-founder of Red Fern Animal Rescue in Denver, told <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/10/colorado-pandemic-pet-adoptions/">The Denver Post</a> in January 2021. “There’s just been an onslaught of people wanting to adopt.”

                    The low supply of animals at shelters in 2020 and 2021 were driven by fewer stray animals during the pandemic and fewer people relinquishing their pets. In addition, the number of owner-intended euthanasia, transfers from other agencies and other intakes also went down, as Chart 3 shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This could be a result of more people staying home and taking care of their pets, which led to reduced animals in the streets and better animal health.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The numbers of people relinquishing their pets in 2020 and 2021, as a percentage of total intakes, stand at 23.9 percent and 24.4 percent, respectively. In 2019, it was 24.2 percent, in 2018, it was 32.7 percent, and in 2017, it was 23.6 percent. The data indicates that owners' relinquishment rate did not go up during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>Contrary to reports of “pandemic pets” filling shelters as restrictions ease, the data from Shelter Animals Count shows a greater percentage of pet adoptions during the pandemic. In fact, as Dr. Marty Greer, a veterinarian, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/us/dog-adoptions-pandemic.html">The New York Times</a>, most people have found their pets to be essential during a tumultuous time.
                </p>
                <p>“They’ve been through a lot together and, when nobody else was there for them, their dog was,” Dr. Greer said.
